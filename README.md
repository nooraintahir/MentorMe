# MentorMe

In this assignment, I built 'MentorMe,' a mentorship app that seamlessly connects mentees with mentors. I implemented essential features such as booking sessions with mentors, facilitating mentor searches, adding mentors to favorites, reviewing mentors and enabling one-to-one and community chats. Additionally, I tackled the maintenance of profiles and the functionality of adding mentors to the platform, expanding the app's reach.
